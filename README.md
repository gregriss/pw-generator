# pw-generator

## Description

This application is designed to generate a secure password using a randomizing method and including various character types.  

## Usage

The password generator is very simple to use. Simply click the red Generate Password button, and a series of prompts will appear to guide you through creating a secure password. Your password may include anywhere from 8 to 128 characters, and may incorporate any combination of special characters, numerical characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase characters. Of course, the greater variety of characters, the more secure your password will be!

If you accidentally select the wrong amount of characters or wish to start over, the series of prompts can be completed as many times as you wish!
